              <h1>Behind the Brand</h1>
              <p>
                PT Hub was created because I wanted more than just workouts — I
                wanted a system that makes training efficient, structured, and
                focused. At just <strong>15 years old</strong>, I built PT Hub
                to balance school, running, and the gym while chasing a much
                bigger dream.
              </p>
              <p>
                Inspired by HYROX and hybrid athletes, I knew I needed a plan
                that would get results, keep me disciplined, and prove that age
                doesn’t limit ambition.

            <h2>The Vision</h2>
            <p>
              PT Hub isn’t just about training plans — it’s about building
              champions. Every rep, every test, every session is designed to
              push further. My personal mission is clear:
              <strong>I will be a HYROX World Champion one day.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              But PT Hub is for more than me — it’s for anyone who wants to
              train smarter, get stronger, and become more resilient.
